This game, Little Fighter 2 Remastered, excluding the open-source libraries listed below and any royalty-free assets, consists of original works by Marti Wong. These works are copyrighted to him and are licensed for commercial use by Little Fighter Co Pty Ltd.

Legacy Attribution

This game is a remastered version of Little Fighter 2, originally released between 2000 and 2008.

The original Little Fighter 2 was created by Marti Wong and Starsky Wong. Marti Wong was responsible for the game's design, artwork, programming, engine development, and virtually every other aspect of the project, except for the networking library. Starsky Wong contributed by developing the WebSock networking library used for network mode and also assisted with testing.

The prequel to Little Fighter 2, titled Little Fighter, was released between 1995 and 1997. It was solely created by Marti Wong, who handled every aspect of the game, including design, artwork, and implementation.

A Note from Marti on the Use of AI

AI was used in the creation of certain visual assets, including character avatars, title screen artwork, promotional materials, and background art. However, these assets still required substantial manual work such as design, sketching, outline drawing, and polishing. The AI was used primarily as a tool for coloring and enhancement, and it did not dictate the creative direction. The visual style remains faithful to the original Little Fighter 2.

The character sprites, which I personally consider the soul of the game and the core of over 90 percent of the gameplay experience, were all hand-drawn in Photoshop using a drawing tablet. I also animated and composed them frame by frame using a custom animation tool I developed myself. This process alone took thousands of hours.

Some people assume that because AI was used in certain artwork, it must have been applied throughout the entire project. That is far from the truth. I used AI primarily for large-scale visual tasks. To give a clearer picture: the game includes over 3,000 hand-crafted sprite frames, composed from thousands of hand-drawn body parts. In contrast, only about 100 images were AI-assisted, and many of those, such as promotional artwork, don't even appear in the actual game.

I understand that some people may have concerns about the use of AI in the creative process. But I hope people can see the broader context and appreciate the amount of manual effort that went into making this game. That said, AI did help save me a few work—months that was crucial for helping the project stay on track (even though it still faced several delays) and for preventing a few more months of burning through my personal savings.

Please know that I'm a solo developer working with a limited budget. I left my job to work on this project, without expecting it to cover even half of my previous salary. I've done my best to balance quality and practicality. Your understanding and support mean a great deal to me.
